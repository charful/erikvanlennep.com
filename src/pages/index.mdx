  Hey there! I am Erik.

  I train, consult and coach on topics around Sustainable Innovation. I also host the [_Designers of Paradise_ podcast](https://rasa.ag/designers/) on regenerative culture. I can help you design and align your sustainability projects and team for optimum impact.

  I started this blog as a toolbox of ideas I feel are important for the 'Re' agenda of our times: Rethinking, Reconnection, Regeneration and Renewal.
